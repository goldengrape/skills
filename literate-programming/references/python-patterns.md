# Python Architecture Patterns (Literate Style)

When analyzing Python projects, focus on these "Literary Devices":

## 1. Entry Points
- `manage.py` / `wsgi.py`: The "Foreword" (Django).
- `__init__.py`: The "Prologue" of a package.
- `main.py`: The "Opening Scene".

## 2. Structural Analysis
- **Imports**: Analyze imports to see the "Social Network" of the modules.
- **Decorators**: Describe them as "Modifiers" to the story's behavior.
- **Dunder Methods**: Explain them as "Hidden Magic" of Python classes.

## 3. Recommended Reading Order
1. `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` (The "Cast List").
2. Core models / Data classes.
3. Utility functions / Helpers.
4. Business logic orchestrators.
