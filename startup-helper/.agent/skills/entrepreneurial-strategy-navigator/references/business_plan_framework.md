# The Modern Business Plan: The Seth Godin Framework

Based on the framework proposed by Seth Godin, this approach replaces traditional, long-winded documents with a concise yet profound five-element structure.

## The Problem with Traditional Business Plans

❌ **Traditional BP Pitfalls**:
- 50-page slide decks filled with generic market reports and dubious financial projections.
- Built on a house of cards: massive, unverified assumptions.
- Weeks of writing only to be rejected in a 2-minute skim.
- Focused on "looking professional" rather than the core business logic.

✅ **The Modern BP Strategy**:
- Extremely concise (can be a one-pager).
- Obsessed with core assumptions and the causal chain.
- Explicitly identifies risks and alternative paths.
- Designed for rapid iteration.

## The Five-Element Framework

### 1. The Truth: How the World Is Right Now

**Definition**: An objective description of the current market state, free from subjective wishing.

**Core Mission**:
- Act as a "Fact Checker."
- Identify the founder's cognitive blind spots.
- Challenge unrealistic assumptions about the status quo.

**Critical Questions**:
1. What is the current market reality?
2. How do customers solve this problem today? (Every alternative is a competitor).
3. Why hasn't this been solved properly yet?
4. What "industry common sense" is actually outdated or wrong?

**Common Blind Spots**:

| Blind Spot | Founder Says | Truth Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Competition Illusion** | "We have no competitors." | Status quo/manual alternatives are competitors. |
| **Demand Assumption** | "Everyone needs this." | Need ≠ Willingness to Pay. Free vs. Paid are different worlds. |
| **Tech Fetishism** | "Our tech is more advanced." | Customers care about outcomes, not algorithms. |
| **Inflated TAM** | "This is a multi-billion dollar market." | TAM is global; what is your *obtainable* market (SOM)? |

### 2. The Assertion: How We Intend to Change the World

**Definition**: A clear statement of your core hypotheses and the resultant causal chain.

**Core Mission**:
- Assist the user in defining clear "If-Then" logic.
- Identify the single most critical assumption in the chain.

**Structured Assertion**:
> **If we** [Action A]
> **Then** [Result B] will occur
> **Because** [Assumption C]
> **This leads to** [Business Value D]

**Example**:
> **If we**: Provide an AI-automated editing tool for TikTok creators.
> **Then**: Creator posting frequency will increase by 3x.
> **Because**: Editing is the single biggest bottleneck (80% of creative time).
> **This leads to**: Creators paying a monthly subscription of $29.

### 3. Alternatives: What If the Assertion Fails?

**Definition**: Honest preparation for risk and the drafting of a Plan B.

**Core Mission**:
- Perform pressure tests.
- Identify "Kill Switches" (When is it time to Pivot?).

**Pressure Test Questions**:
1. If CAC is 5x higher than expected, is the business still viable?
2. If the conversion rate is only 10% of the projection, what then?
3. If retention drops below 40%, what does that signal about the product?
4. If a tech giant (e.g., Google) clones your feature, what is your moat?

### 4. People: Who is on the Bus?

**Definition**: Evaluating the "Founder-Market Fit."

**Core Mission**:
- Identify the team's "Unfair Advantage."
- Spot critical skill gaps.

**Key Questions**:
1. Why you? Why this team for this specific maze?
2. What unique maps or insights do you possess?
3. What critical skills are missing from the founding team?

**Unfair Advantage Types**:
- **Insider Knowledge**: 10 years in the specific industry.
- **Deep Tech**: PhD/Patents in the core technology.
- **Network/Distribution**: Direct access to 10,000 target customers.
- **Ops Excellence**: Proven ability to execute in low-margin environments.

### 5. Money: The Laws of Physics

**Definition**: The mathematical relationship between funding and the growth heartbeat.

**Core Mission**:
- Anchor funding requests to growth targets (5-7% weekly).
- Calculate "Runway" accurately.

**Key Metrics**:
1. **Weekly Growth Cost**: How much capital is required to sustain 5-7% growth?
2. **Runway**: Current Cash / Monthly Burn Rate.
3. **Unit Economics**: LTV (Life Time Value) / CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost). Healthy = > 3.

**Runway Safety Zones**:
- **> 18 months**: Safe.
- **12 - 18 months**: Healthy.
- **6 - 12 months**: Caution (Start fundraising now).
- **< 6 months**: Danger (Immediate intervention required).

## Interaction Loop Example

1. **Navigator**: "Let's map your Truth. You say there's no competition for B2B HR tools. How do managers handle payroll right now?"
2. **User**: "They use complex Excel sheets."
3. **Navigator**: "Then Excel is your primary competitor. Why will a manager switch from a 'free' tool they already know to your paid tool? That is your core **Assertion**."
4. **User**: "My assertion is that the risk of tax error in Excel is worth $500/month in insurance."
5. **Navigator**: "Okay. Now, for the **Alternatives**: If we find that HR managers actually *accept* the risk of error, what is Plan B?"

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Conciseness > Length**: A one-pager beats a 50-slide deck.
2. **Logic > Data**: A clear causal chain beats a generic market report.
3. **Honesty > Optimism**: Acknowledging risks creates trust and better strategy.
4. **Dynamic > Static**: A business plan is a living experiment, updated monthly.
5. **Verifiability > Feasibility**: Focus on what you can test *now*.
