# VC Perspective: Simulating Top-Tier Venture Capital Evaluation

This document assists the Agent in evaluating startup projects from the perspective of elite VCs like Y Combinator (YC) and Sequoia Capital, providing critical, unbiased feedback.

## Y Combinator (YC) Evaluation Standards

### The Four Pillars of Evaluation
YC focuses on four core elements, with the highest weight placed on verifiable numbers:

| Pillar | Weight | Focus | Benchmark |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Idea** | 10% | Clarity, Innovation, Logicality | Can explain in one sentence |
| **2. The Market** | 20% | TAM, Potential for Growth | TAM > $1.0 Billion |
| **3. The Team** | 30% | Execution, Resilience, Fit | "Cockroach" tenacity |
| **4. Traction** | 40% | Growth rate, Retention | 5-7% Weekly Growth |

**Core Insight**: Traction is the most heavily weighted (40%) because it is the only objective evidence.

### 1. Idea Evaluation (10%)
- **Clarity Test**: Can it be explained in a single, simple sentence without jargon?
  - ✅ **Good**: "We are Stripe for Africa, a payment gateway for businesses in Lagos."
  - ❌ **Bad**: "We leverage AI and blockchain to revolutionize synergy in the logistics space."
- **Problem Legitimacy**: Does it solve a real, acute pain point (Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have)?
- **"Why Now?"**: Is there a specific technological or behavioral shift making this possible today?

### 2. Market Evaluation (20%)
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: The theoretical maximum if everyone in the world bought the product.
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: The portion within reach given current geography/tech.
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: The realistic portion you can capture in the next 18 months.

**YC Standards**:
- ❌ **TAM < $100M**: "Lifestyle business"; not venture-backable.
- ⚠️ **TAM $100M - $1B**: Niche; requires caution.
- ✅ **TAM > $1B**: Minimal standard for a venture scale.
- 🦄 **TAM > $10B**: Unicorn potential.

### 3. Team Evaluation (30%)
**The "Cockroach" Test**: Paul Graham’s famous metaphor for founders who are nearly impossible to kill.
- **Resilience**: Do they give up when things go wrong?
- **Speed**: How quickly do they ship?
- **Learnability**: Can they take 100 "Nos" and refine the pitch/product each time?

**Founder-Market Fit (FMF)**: Why are *you* uniquely qualified to solve this? Do you have a map of the maze that others don't?

### 4. Traction Evaluation (40%) - MOST IMPORTANT
The growth curve does not lie.
- **探索期 (Exploration)**: Are users paying or using the product deeply? (Retention > 40%).
- **增长期 (Climbing)**: Is there a 5-7% stable weekly growth rate?
- **Recap**: If growth is < 1% weekly, you are in the "Death Zone."

## The Sequoia Capital Investment Memo Framework

### 1. Company Purpose
Refine the mission into a short, punchy sentence.
- ✅ **Airbnb**: "Belong anywhere."
- ✅ **Stripe**: "Increase the GDP of the internet."

### 2. Problem Statement
- **Pain Score**: 1-3 (Annoyance), 4-6 (Significant pain), 7-9 (Acute misery), 10 (Hair on fire).
- **Sequoia Benchmark**: Must be a score of 7+. If the problem isn't "on fire," people won't pay.

### 3. Solution
**The 10x Rule**: A product must be 10x better than the incumbent (in price, speed, or quality) to overcome the friction of switching.

### 4. Competitive Advantage (The Moat)
Identify the "Unfair Advantage":
- **Network Effects**: Value increases with every user (Facebook).
- **Data Moat**: Unique datasets that improve the product (Google Search).
- **Switching Costs**: Integration is so deep it's painful to leave (Salesforce).

### 5. Business Model (Unit Economics)
- **LTV / CAC Calculation**: LTV (Lifetime Value) divided by CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).
- **Healthy Threshold**: **LTV/CAC > 3**.
- **Payback Period**: How many months to recover CAC? (Healthy < 12 months).

## "Devil's Advocate" Mode (Critical Audit)

When switched to this mode, the Navigator will attack the business's weakest links:
1. **The Scale Trap**: "Will your CAC rise as you move beyond early adopters?"
2. **The Incumbent Attack**: "If Google/Amazon clones this tomorrow, how do you survive?"
3. **The 'Mom' Test**: "Who, besides your colleagues and family, has actually paid for this? Show me the Stripe invoice."

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Traction Over Everything**: Growth data is the only truth.
2. **The 10x Improvement Rule**: Don't build "marginal" improvements.
3. **LTV/CAC > 3**: A non-negotiable standard for business sustainability.
4. **Cockroach Tenacity**: Founders must be the most resilient part of the system.
5. **5-7% Weekly**: This is the heart rate of a healthy startup.
