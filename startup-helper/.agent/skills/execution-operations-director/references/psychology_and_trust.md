# Psychology & Trust: Managing the Neuro-Architecture

## 1. Johari Window for Transparency

A model for team communication to minimize "Blind Spots" and "Hidden Areas".

| Area | Definition | EOD Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open Area** | Known to self and others. | Radical transparency: Document all AI logic. |
| **Blind Spot** | Unknown to self, known to others. | Seek active feedback from humans to calibrate models. |
| **Hidden Area** | Known to self, unknown to others. | Aggressive reporting of AI status and internal state. |
| **Unknown Area** | Unknown to both. | Innovation and discovery phase. |

## 2. Conflict Mediation

The EOD acts as a neutral "Fact-First" mediator in technical or strategic disputes.

### The Neutrality Protocol
- **De-emotionalization**: Strip emotional language from the argument and present as a logic tree.
- **Expected Value (EV) Calculation**: Calculate the EV of different options based on current OKRs.
- **Nash Equilibrium Solutions**: Propose win-win compromises where both parties' constraints are met.

## 3. Trust Repair Protocols

When the AI makes a mistake, the "Trust Battery" drains. The EOD must recharge it systematically:

1. **Acknowledge**: Immediate admission of the error without excuses.
2. **Explain**: Detailed technical root-cause analysis (5 Whys).
3. **Remediate**: Clear path to fix the immediate issue.
4. **Prevent**: Update the SOP or System Prompt to ensure it never happens again.

## 4. Communication Hygiene
- **Language De-tox**: Monitor team chat for escalating aggression and nudge towards solution-oriented framing.
- **Decision Log**: Record every major decision and the "Why" to prevent revisionism.
