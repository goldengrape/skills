# SAISE Framework: Systematic AI-driven Startup Evaluation

The SAISE framework provides a principled, theory-backed approach to evaluating startups and making technical decisions.

## Five-Stage Normative Roadmap

### 1. Stage-Aware Problem Definition
Identify the startup's lifecycle stage (e.g., Seed, Series A, Series C). Technical requirements and risk profiles shift dramatically between stages.
- **Early Stage**: Focus on speed, MVP, and finding Problem-Solution Fit.
- **Late Stage**: Focus on scalability, reliability, and technical debt management.

### 2. Theory-Guided Data Synthesis
Do not just collect "Big Data." Use management and economic theories to filter and synthesize data.
- Ensure input data has documented theoretical relevance to success.
- Focus on "Deep Data" (high information density) rather than volume.

### 3. Principled Feature Engineering
Extract features that imply causality rather than mere correlation.
- Identify latent indicators of technical health and market readiness.
- Focus on features that define the technical moat (e.g., unique data loops, algorithmic efficiency).

### 4. Rigorous Validation
Use strict validation protocols to avoid "overfitting" to historical success.
- **Time-series splitting**: Simulate real-world prediction by testing on chronological data subsets.
- Avoid look-ahead bias in data preparation.

### 5. Risk-Aware Explanation
Provide probability distributions and risk intervals instead of binary "pass/fail" results.
- Help stakeholders understand the *uncertainty* inherent in technical decisions.
- Use explainable AI (XAI) to reveal why certain architectures or strategies are recommended.
