# PMF Validation & Lifecycle Protocol

Validation of Product-Market Fit (PMF) is the primary goal for early-stage ventures.

## 1. Technological Adoption Lifecycle
Identify where the product sits:
- **Early Adopters**: Visionaries who value tech/edge over stability.
- **The Chasm**: The gap between visionaries and pragmatists.
- **Early Majority**: Pragmatists who require a "Whole Product" and social proof.

**Strategy**: If a product is stuck at the chasm, the analyst must recommend pivoting from "feature/tech" sales to "stability/integration" sales.

## 2. The 40% Rule (Sean Ellis Test)
The definitive PMF metric.
- **Question**: "How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"
- **Metric**: If $>40\%$ of respondents say **"Very Disappointed"**, PMF is likely achieved.
- **Analyst Role**: Use NLP to categorize open-ended survey results or social reviews into these sentiment buckets.

## 3. Status Quo Bias & Inaction
In B2B, the biggest competitor is "No Decision".
- **Inaction Inertia**: People fear loss more than they value gain.
- **Quantifying COI (Cost of Inaction)**: Construct a ROI calculator for the user that focuses specifically on the *losses* incurred by not moving (e.g., wasted labor, data leakage risk).
- **Overcoming Paralysis**: Recommend "Decision Archetypes" (Standardized buying guides) to help customers who are overwhelmed by choice.
