# Alternative Data Signal Interpretation

Use these "hidden" signals to gain a competitive advantage and detect market shifts before they are visible in financial data.

## 1. GitHub Signals (Tech Momentum)
- **Star Velocity**: The rate of growth in stars. High velocity often indicates a tech is crossing from "Early Adopters" to "Early Majority".
- **Contributor Density**: Frequent commits and diverse contributors indicate a healthy, iterating ecosystem.
- **Issues & Community PMF**: High issue closure rates combined with active discussions suggest high Product-Market Fit within the developer community.
- **Talent Hunting**: If engineers from big tech (Google, Meta, etc.) are forking a project, it signal's big tech's technical interest.

## 2. Patent Intelligence (Innovation Radar)
- **White Space Analysis**: Identify clusters of high patent density and target the gaps ("low density zones") for Blue Ocean opportunities.
- **Citation Network**: If a startup's patent is cited by many subsequent filings, they hold "Foundational Tech".
- **Geographic Mapping**: Track where competitors are filing to predict their next target markets.

## 3. Social & Footprint Signals
- **JD Analysis (Job Descriptions)**: If a competitor is hiring "Enterprise Sales" and "Security Compliance Engineers", they are moving up-market to B2B.
- **Sentiment Benchmarking**: Use proxy NPS (Net Promoter Score) metrics by analyzing the ratio of "Gratitude" vs "Complaint" keywords in social threads.
- **Cost of Inaction (COI)**: Look for user complaints about the current status quo (e.g., "I'm sick of doing X manually"). This helps in building the sales case against "doing nothing".
