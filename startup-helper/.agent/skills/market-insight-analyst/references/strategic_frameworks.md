# Strategic Frameworks Guide

Apply these frameworks to transform raw data into actionable strategic insights.

## 1. 7 Powers Analysis
Evaluate the strength of the "Competitive Moat":
1. **Scale Economies**: Does unit cost drop as volume increases?
2. **Network Effects**: Is the product more valuable as more people use it?
3. **Counter-Positioning**: Does the new business model make it impossible for incumbents to respond without hurting their existing business?
4. **Switching Costs**: How "sticky" is the product? (Search user reviews for keywords like "data migration", "learning curve").
5. **Brand**: Is there a price premium associated with the name?
6. **Cornered Resource**: Does the tech have exclusive patents or licenses?
7. **Process Power**: Are internal operations significantly more efficient?

## 2. Blue Ocean Strategy (ERRC)
For disruptive projects, map the industry value curve and suggest an ERRC Grid:
- **Eliminate**: Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
- **Reduce**: Which factors should be reduced well below the industry's standard?
- **Raise**: Which factors should be raised well above the industry's standard?
- **Create**: Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

## 3. MECE Principle (Problem Decomposition)
All analysis must be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive.
- **No Overlap**: Each category/cause in a tree must be distinct.
- **No Gaps**: The sum of all parts must equal the whole.
- Use a "Diagnosis Tree" when investigating issues like "Declining Market Share" or "Slow User Growth".

## 4. Lean Canvas Mapping
Automatically populate the following blocks from user discussion:
1. **Problem**: Top 3 problems.
2. **Customer Segments**: Who is the target?
3. **Unique Value Proposition**: Single, clear, compelling message.
4. **Solution**: Top 3 features.
5. **Channels**: Path to customers.
6. **Revenue Streams**: Pricing model.
7. **Cost Structure**: Fixed and variable costs.
8. **Key Metrics**: What indicates success?
9. **Unfair Advantage**: Something that cannot be easily copied.
