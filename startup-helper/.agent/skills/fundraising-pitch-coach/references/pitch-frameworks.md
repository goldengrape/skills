# Pitch Deck Frameworks: Structural Engineering for Storytelling

## Top-Tier VC Template Comparison

### Sequoia Capital Template

**Philosophy**: Logic-driven linear progression

**Core structure**:
1. **Problem**: What customer pain exists? (specific, visceral)
2. **Solution**: How does your product solve it? (demo/visual)
3. **Market Opportunity**: How big is the prize? (TAM/SAM/SOM)
4. **Product**: What have you built? (screenshots, workflow)
5. **Business Model**: How do you make money? (unit economics)
6. **Traction**: What proof do you have? (metrics, logos)
7. **Competition**: Who else is trying? (positioning map)
8. **Team**: Why are you the ones? (relevant credentials)
9. **Financials**: Where are you headed? (3-year projection)
10. **Ask**: What do you need? (amount, use of funds)

**Critical addition: "Why Now?"** slide
- Technology inflection: What's newly possible?
- Regulatory shift: What rules changed?
- Behavioral change: What do people do differently now?

**When to use**: Strong logical story, significant market shifts, technical founders

### Y Combinator Template

**Philosophy**: Traction speaks louder than vision

**Key difference**: If growth metrics are strong, **lead with traction**
- Open with growth chart: "We're growing 20% week-over-week"
- Hook investors with proof, then explain the business

**Structure for high-traction companies**:
1. **Traction First**: Growth curve (shocking visual)
2. **One-liner**: What you do (simple)
3. **Problem/Solution**: Brief context
4. **How it works**: Product mechanics
5. **Market size**: Opportunity scale
6. **Team**: Builder credentials
7. **Ask**: Capital needed

**When to use**: Strong existing metrics (>5-7% weekly growth), B2C products with viral potential

### Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Template

**Philosophy**: Vision-driven, platform thinking

**Emphasis**:
- Macro trends creating new markets
- "Building the future" narrative
- Network effects and platform dynamics

**Structure**:
1. **Vision**: The world we're building
2. **Market transformation**: Why the old way is dying
3. **Unique insight**: What you see that others miss
4. **Product**: Your platform/infrastructure play
5. **Traction & Metrics**: Evidence of momentum
6. **Team**: World-class builders
7. **Competitive moat**: Why you'll win long-term

**When to use**: Infrastructure/platform plays, market-creating (not just market-taking) companies

## Pyramid Principle Application

### Core Concept

Every communication should follow **top-down logic**:
- Lead with the conclusion
- Support with grouped arguments
- Ensure MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

### Slide Title Review Protocol

**Rule**: Each slide title must be a **governing thought**, not a topic label

❌ **Bad** (topic labels):
- "Market Opportunity"
- "Our Team"
- "Competitive Landscape"

✅ **Good** (governing thoughts):
- "The Telehealth Market Will Reach $250B by 2025"
- "We're Ex-Google Engineers Who Built Similar Systems at Scale"
- "Incumbents Are Vulnerable Due to Legacy Infrastructure"

### Logical Structure Audit

**Vertical test** (within a slide):
- Does each bullet support the slide title?
- Could you remove a bullet and still prove the headline? (If yes, it's redundant)

**Horizontal test** (across slides):
- Are the main points MECE?
- Is there a logical flow from one slide to the next?
- Could slides be reordered without losing coherence? (If yes, flow is weak)

### Example: Problem Slide Pyramid

**Title (conclusion)**: "Healthcare Providers Waste $60B Annually on Manual Billing"

**Supporting points** (MECE):
1. Manual data entry causes 30% error rate
2. Claims take 90 days average to process
3. 40% of small practices hire full-time billing staff

Each point is:
- **Mutually exclusive**: No overlap between error rate, processing time, staffing cost
- **Collectively exhaustive**: Covers the major cost drivers
- **Supports the headline**: All add up to the $60B waste claim

## Why Now Slide: Critical Timing Narrative

Investors hear countless pitches. The question they're asking: **Why is this the moment for your company?**

### Three Dimensions of "Why Now"

**1. Technology Inflection**
- "GPUs are now affordable enough for real-time video processing"
- "LLMs crossed the reliability threshold for production deployment"
- "5G enables latency-sensitive applications mobile-first"

**2. Regulatory Change**
- "GDPR created demand for privacy-preserving analytics"
- "Recent FDA guidance allows AI-assisted diagnostics"
- "Open banking regulations force incumbent unbundling"

**3. Social/Behavioral Shift**
- "Remote work normalized B2B sales via video"
- "Gen Z expects creator monetization tools"
- "ESG consciousness makes sustainability a buying criterion"

### Constructing the Why Now Slide

**Format**:
```
Title: "Three Tailwinds Create a $10B Opportunity Now"

[Timeline graphic showing convergence of trends]

2020: Technology X became viable
2022: Regulation Y passed
2024: Consumer behavior Z tipped
→ 2025: Our window opens
```

**Anti-pattern**: "This is a big market" (that's not "why now", that's "why ever")

## Template Selection Decision Tree

Use this logic to choose the right framework:

```
Do you have strong traction (>10% MoM growth)?
├─ YES → YC template (lead with metrics)
└─ NO
    └─ Are you creating a new market category?
        ├─ YES → a16z template (vision-driven)
        └─ NO → Sequoia template (logic-driven)
```

**Mixed approach**: You can combine elements, but maintain one **dominant narrative arc**

## Common Structural Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The "About Us" Opening

❌ Opening with team slide
✅ Open with problem or traction (earn the right to talk about yourself)

### Mistake 2: The Feature Dump

❌ Listing every product capability
✅ Show 1-2 key workflows that solve the core problem

### Mistake 3: The Ambiguous Ask

❌ "We're raising a seed round"
✅ "We're raising $2M at a $10M cap to achieve X, Y, Z milestones over 18 months"

### Mistake 4: Buried Traction

❌ Hiding metrics on slide 15
✅ If you have compelling traction, put it in slides 1-3

### Mistake 5: Competitor Denial

❌ "We have no competitors"
✅ "Incumbents do X poorly, we do Y better - here's proof"

## Slide-by-Slide Quality Checklist

For each slide, verify:
- [ ] Title is a conclusion, not a topic
- [ ] Visual supports the title (not decorative)
- [ ] Maximum 3-4 bullets (or less)
- [ ] No jargon that an intelligent non-expert wouldn't understand
- [ ] Answers investor's implicit question: "So what?"
