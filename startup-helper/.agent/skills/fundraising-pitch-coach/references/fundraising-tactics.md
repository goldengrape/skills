# Fundraising Tactics: Operational Playbook

## Investor Funnel Stratification

**Critical principle**: NOT all investors are equal. Prioritize ruthlessly.

### Three-Tier System

| Tier | Description | Timing | Purpose |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Tier 1: Dream Funds** | Ideal brand, network, terms | Meet LAST | Close when you have leverage |
| **Tier 2: Target Funds** | Good fit, realistic prospects | Meet MIDDLE | Build momentum |
| **Tier 3: Practice Targets** | Long shots, warm-up funds | Meet FIRST | Collect feedback, refine story |

### Tier Assignment Criteria

**Tier 1 indicators**:
- Portfolio companies you admire
- Partners with domain expertise in your space
- Known for being founder-friendly
- Value-add beyond capital (recruiting, BD, strategic guidance)

**Tier 2 indicators**:
- Thesis alignment with your company
- Check size matches your needs
- Active in your stage/geography
- Positive reputation in founder community

**Tier 3 indicators**:
- Responded to cold outreach (weak signal)
- Potential fit but unproven
- Use for testing pitch, not expecting close

### Sequencing Strategy

**Week 1-2**: Tier 3 (Practice)
- Schedule 5-10 meetings
- **Goal**: Surface objections, refine answers
- Expect most to pass - that's fine

**Week 3-4**: Tier 2 (Targets)
- Schedule 10-15 meetings (compress timeline)
- **Goal**: Generate term sheets, build FOMO
- Use Tier 3 feedback to tighten pitch

**Week 5-6**: Tier 1 (Dream)
- Schedule 5-8 top choice meetings
- **Goal**: Close the lead investor
- Enter with "we have strong interest from [Tier 2 funds]"

**Key**: Never burn Tier 1 on your worst pitch iteration

## Parallel vs Serial Fundraising

**Serial approach** (WRONG):
- Talk to one investor at a time
- Wait for their decision before moving to next
- **Result**: Takes 6+ months, zero leverage

**Parallel approach** (RIGHT):
- Talk to all investors in 4-6 week window
- Create perception of competitive process
- **Result**: Compress timeline, manufacture urgency

### Tactical Schedule Compression

**Goal**: First meetings within 1-2 week span

**Outreach pattern**:
- Send all intro requests the same week
- When scheduling: "I'm meeting investors the week of [date] - Tuesday 2pm or Thursday 10am work?"
- Limited availability = demand signal

**Follow-up meetings**:
- Partner meetings within 2 weeks of first meeting
- "We're moving quickly - aiming to close in 3 weeks"
- Legitimate urgency creates FOMO

## FOMO Creation Scripts

Fear of missing out is manufactured through **scarcity cues** and **social proof**.

### Using Follow Investors as Leverage

**Scenario**: You have soft commits from 3 follow investors, but no lead yet

**Script to potential lead**:
"We've had great conversations with [Fund B], [Fund C], and [Fund D]. They're excited to participate, but we're looking for the right lead partner. Based on your portfolio work with [Company X], I think you'd be the ideal fit."

**Translation**: "Others want in - you should move fast"

### Updating on Momentum

**Email template** (send to all active prospects):
```
Subject: [Company] Update - Strong Momentum

Hi [Name],

Quick update since we chatted: 
- Signed 2 new enterprise customers ([Brand] and [Brand])
- Revenue grew 18% last month
- Fielding strong interest from several funds

Wanted to keep you in the loop. Do you have time for a follow-up this week or next?

[Your name]
```

**What this signals**:
- Business is working (not desperate)
- Other investors are interested (social proof)
- Time is limited (scarcity)

### The "Round is Coming Together" Signal

**Use when**: You have verbal interest but no term sheet yet

**Script**:
"We're assembling a great syndicate - have verbal commits from [Fund A] and [Fund B]. We're finalizing terms this week and will be ready to close in 10 days. If [your fund] wants to participate, we should move quickly."

**Note**: Don't lie. "Verbal commits" can be "very interested" - but read the room.

## Email Signal Audit

Investors read between the lines. Eliminate desperation cues:

### Red Flags to Remove

❌ "Just following up again..." (sounds desperate after 2nd follow-up)
✅ Don't follow up more than twice; move on

❌ "Let me know if you need anything else" (weak, submissive)
✅ "Happy to provide [specific info] - let me know"

❌ "I'm free anytime this week" (signals you're not busy)
✅ "I have Tuesday 2pm or Thursday 10am - either work?"

❌ "We really need this funding to..." (desperation)
✅ "This capital will allow us to [accelerate/expand/validate]..."

### Green Flags to Amplify

✅ "We're seeing strong traction - happy to share latest metrics"
✅ "Multiple funds have expressed interest - want to find the right partner"
✅ "We're moving quickly - aiming to close by [specific date]"

## Lead Investor Negotiation

Once you have term sheets, the power dynamics shift.

### Understanding the BATNA

**BATNA** = Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement

- If you have multiple term sheets → strong BATNA
- If you have one term sheet → moderate BATNA  
- If you have zero term sheets → weak BATNA

**Implication**: Don't start negotiating until you have at least 2 serious offers

### Key Terms to Negotiate

**1. Valuation (Post-Money)**
- Most visible term
- Benchmark against similar rounds (use Crunchbase, PitchBook)
- Don't over-optimize (better to get right partner at slightly lower valuation)

**2. Option Pool**
- **Trap**: "Post-money includes 20% option pool"
  - This dilutes founders before new capital comes in
- **Ask**: "Option pool should come from post-money, not pre-money"

**3. Board Composition**
- Series A: Expect investor gets 1 seat
- Preserve founder control where possible
- Avoid even-numbered boards (deadlock risk)

**4. Liquidation Preference**
- Standard: 1x non-participating
- **Red flag**: >1x or participating preferred (investor gets multiple bites)

**5. Pro-Rata Rights**
- Allows investors to maintain ownership % in future rounds
- Usually non-negotiable, but reasonable

### When to Walk Away

**Deal-breakers**:
- Multiple liquidation preference (2x or higher)
- Participating preferred (double-dipping)
- Full-ratchet anti-dilution (punishes you for down rounds)
- Excessive board control
- Personal liability clauses

**Remember**: No deal is better than a bad deal

## Valuation & Equity Literacy

### Basic Cap Table Math

**Post-money valuation** = Pre-money valuation + Investment amount

**Example**:
- Raising: $2M
- Pre-money valuation: $8M
- Post-money valuation: $10M
- Investor ownership: $2M / $10M = 20%

### Dilution Over Multiple Rounds

**Seed**: Raise $1M at $5M post → 20% dilution
**Series A**: Raise $5M at $20M post → 25% dilution
**Series B**: Raise $15M at $75M post → 20% dilution

**Founder ownership trajectory**:
- Post-seed: 80% (if started at 100%)
- Post-A: 60% (80% × 75%)
- Post-B: 48% (60% × 80%)

**Key insight**: Dilution is cumulative - every round compounds

### Option Pool Mechanics

**Standard**: 15-20% option pool for employee equity

**Timing matters**:
- Pool created pre-money → dilutes founders only
- Pool created post-money → dilutes everyone

**Negotiation**:
- "What % pool do you need to see?"
- Push for smaller pool if you don't plan to hire aggressively
- Or argue pool should be post-money

## Common Fundraising Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting Too Late

❌ Starting when you have 3 months runway
✅ Starting when you have 9-12 months runway

**Reason**: Fundraising takes longer than expected; desperation kills deals

### Mistake 2: Lack of Preparation

❌ "Let's just take meetings and see what happens"
✅ Complete deck, practiced pitch, data room ready

**Investors smell unpreparedness** - it signals poor execution

### Mistake 3: Negotiating Too Hard Too Early

❌ Fighting over every term before commitment
✅ Build relationship first, negotiate terms once they're committed

**Reason**: Early-stage investing is relationship-driven; don't be adversarial

### Mistake 4: Ignoring the Partner

❌ Focusing only on the fund brand
✅ Evaluating the specific partner you'll work with

**Reality**: You're marrying the partner, not the fund logo

### Mistake 5: Taking the First Offer

❌ Accepting the first term sheet without shopping
✅ Using first offer to create urgency with others

**Exception**: If it's truly your dream investor at fair terms, taking it can be smart

## Rejection Response Framework

### Decoding Investor Passes

| Investor Says | Actually Means | Your Move |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| "Too early for us" | Don't see traction yet | Build metrics, come back in 6 months |
| "Not our thesis" | Polite pass, move on | Don't follow up |
| "Let's stay in touch" | Soft no, but keeping door open | Add to quarterly update list |
| "Send us an update when..." | Conditional interest | Note the trigger, update when achieved |

### Staying in Touch (Without Being Annoying)

**Frequency**: Quarterly updates
**Format**: Brief email (3-4 bullets)
**Content**:
- Key metric improvements
- Major wins (customers, partnerships, press)
- New milestone unlocked

**Example**:
```
Subject: [Company] Q1 Update

Hi [Name],

Quick update since we last spoke:
- Hit $50K MRR (up from $30K in December)
- Signed [Brand Name] as enterprise customer
- Grew team to 8 (hired ex-[Company] eng lead)

Would love to reconnect if you're interested in our Series A later this year.

[Your Name]
```

### Converting Nos to Yeses

**Pattern**: Investor passes on Seed, leads Series A

**Why it happens**:
- Early risk tolerance varies
- Traction proves the model
- Relationship already established

**Takeaway**: Every pass is a potential future yes - don't burn bridges
