# Q&A Playbook: Mock Interrogation Engine

## VC Question Taxonomy

Questions cluster into three categories by intent and difficulty:

### Category 1: Foundation Questions

**Purpose**: Confirm basic understanding of business and team

**Common questions**:
- "Walk me through what you do in one sentence"
- "Who are your customers and what problem are you solving?"
- "How did this team come together?"
- "What's your background in this space?"

**How to answer**:
- Crisp, jargon-free explanations
- Demonstrates clarity of thought
- Shows team cohesion and complementary skills

### Category 2: Mechanism Questions

**Purpose**: Test business model viability and unit economics

**Common questions**:
- "What's your CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)?"
- "What's the LTV (Lifetime Value) of a customer?"
- "What's your churn rate and how does it trend over time?"
- "How long does it take to get to payback on CAC?"
- "What are your gross margins?"
- "How do you acquire customers today vs at scale?"

**How to answer**:
- Have the numbers memorized (fumbling here is fatal)
- Show understanding of how metrics evolve
- Demonstrate you know what good looks like (benchmarks)

**Example strong answer**:
"Our CAC is currently $400, LTV is $2,800, so we have a 7:1 ratio. Payback period is 8 months. Industry standard is 3:1 and 12-month payback, so we're significantly better. We expect CAC to decrease as we build brand and word-of-mouth."

### Category 3: Trap Questions

**Purpose**: Test ambition, strategic thinking, and self-awareness

These have "right" and "wrong" answers that reveal founder mindset.

## Common Trap Questions & How to Handle

### "What's your exit strategy?"

**Wrong answer**: "We're building to be acquired by [BigCo]"
- Signals small thinking
- VCs want founders building independent giants

**Right answer**: "We're building an independent, category-defining company. If we execute, we could be the acquirer, not the acquired. That said, if there's a strategic opportunity that's right for our shareholders, we'd consider it - but that's not the plan."

**Key**: Show you're thinking about IPO-scale outcomes

### "What if [Google/Amazon/BigCo] builds this?"

**Wrong answer**: "They won't notice us" or "They're too slow"
- Sounds naive

**Right answer**: Address via structural moat
- "They could, but they won't because [innovator's dilemma/conflict of interest]"
- "By the time they react, we'll have [network effects/data moat/customer lock-in]"
- "We're actually aggregating their competitors, so we're more valuable as Switzerland"

### "Who are your competitors?"

**Wrong answer**: "We have no competitors"
- Red flag: signals either lying or no market validation

**Right answer**: "Customers solve this today via [existing solution]. The incumbents are [names]. But they all miss [key insight], which is our wedge."

**Structure**:
1. Acknowledge competition (shows you're grounded in reality)
2. Explain their limitation
3. Highlight your differentiation
4. Prove customers care about that difference (evidence)

### "What's your moat?"

**Wrong answer**: Any of these:
- "Our algorithm" (can be copied)
- "First mover advantage" (temporary)
- "Better UX" (subjective, easily copied)
- "Our team" (they can be hired away)

**Right answer**: Reference 7 Powers framework (see below)

## The 7 Powers: Building Defensibility

When discussing moats, reference these durable competitive advantages:

### 1. Network Effects
- Value increases as more users join
- "Every restaurant added makes diners more valuable, every diner makes restaurants more valuable"
- **Evidence needed**: Show how growth accelerates value (not just more users)

### 2. Switching Costs
- Painful to leave once integrated
- "We become the system of record - rip-and-replace means data migration, retraining, and workflow disruption"
- **Evidence needed**: High retention rate, failed churn attempts

### 3. Scale Economies
- Unit costs decrease with volume
- "At 1M transactions/day, our per-transaction cost is 1/10th of competitors doing 10K/day"
- **Evidence needed**: Show the cost curve improvement

### 4. Brand
- Premium pricing power due to reputation
- Only works in consumer markets
- **Evidence needed**: Unprompted awareness, pricing premium data

### 5. Proprietary Technology
- Patent protection or significant technical lead
- "Our latency is 50ms vs competitors at 500ms due to [core innovation]"
- **Evidence needed**: Patent filings, published benchmarks

### 6. Cornered Resource
- Exclusive access to supply, distribution, or data
- "We have exclusive partnerships with top 3 suppliers"
- **Evidence needed**: Contracts, unique dataset metrics

### 7. Process Power
- Operational excellence that's hard to replicate
- Usually emerges later, not seed/Series A story

### Combining Powers

**Strongest moats = multiple powers stacked**:
- "We have network effects (more data → better recommendations → more users) AND switching costs (integrated into daily workflow)"

## Socratic Coaching Method

When founders give weak answers, **don't tell them the right answer directly**. Guide through questions:

### Example: Weak Moat Claim

**Founder**: "Our moat is our AI algorithm"

**Coach (Socratic approach)**:
1. "How long would it take a well-funded competitor to build a similar algorithm?"
2. "What happens when GPT-5 makes the algorithmic gap smaller?"
3. "Is there something about your product that gets stronger as you grow?"
4. "Do you have data that competitors can't access?"

**Goal**: Lead founder to discover the real moat (or realize they need to build one)

### Example: Vague Market Size

**Founder**: "It's a huge market"

**Coach (Socratic approach)**:
1. "How much are customers currently spending to solve this problem?"
2. "What percentage of that spending could you realistically capture?"
3. "How would you prioritize the subsegments within this market?"

**Goal**: Force specificity and first-principles thinking

## Advanced Question Patterns

### The Precision Drill

**Test**: Can the founder answer follow-up questions without preparation?

**Pattern**:
- "What's your churn rate?" → "3%/month"
- "How does that vary by cohort?" → (fumbles = they don't know their metrics deeply)
- "What's driving churn in your worst cohort?" → (detailed answer = mastery)

### The Stress Test

**Scenarios designed to test resilience**:
- "What if your CAC doubles?"
- "What if your top engineer quits?"
- "What if your biggest customer churns next month?"

**Good answers show**:
- Contingency planning
- Understanding of key dependencies
- Calm under pressure

### The Vision/Execution Balance

**Dual questions**:
- "Where do you see this in 10 years?" (tests vision)
- "What are you doing this quarter?" (tests execution)

**Red flags**:
- Grand vision but no concrete next steps
- Detailed tactics but no long-term strategy

## Q&A Preparation Protocol

### Step 1: Build Your Question Bank

Categorize likely questions:
- [ ] Foundation (business model, team)
- [ ] Metrics (CAC, LTV, churn, margins)
- [ ] Competition (positioning, moat)
- [ ] Market (TAM, growth, trends)
- [ ] Product (roadmap, tech, differentiation)
- [ ] Risks (what could go wrong)

### Step 2: Memorize Key Metrics

Have instant recall on:
- CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio
- Payback period
- Monthly burn, runway
- Growth rate (MoM, YoY)
- Retention curves
- Gross margins
- Unit economics

### Step 3: Practice Out Loud

- Record yourself answering
- Listen for weak language patterns
- Drill answers until they're < 90 seconds and crisp

### Step 4: Simulate Rapid-Fire

- Have someone fire questions with no prep time
- Practice pivoting between topics quickly
- Build comfort with "I don't know, but here's how I'd find out"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Long-winded answers**: If it takes >2 minutes, you've lost them
✅ **Crisp then detailed**: Answer in 30 seconds, then "happy to go deeper on any aspect"

❌ **Defensive posture**: Getting argumentative when challenged
✅ **Confident curiosity**: "Tell me more about that concern" (shows coachability)

❌ **Buzzword bingo**: "We're leveraging AI/ML to disrupt the paradigm"
✅ **Plain language**: "We use machine learning to predict which leads will convert"

❌ **Avoiding hard questions**: Deflecting or changing topic
✅ **Intellectual honesty**: "That's a gap we're addressing - here's the plan"
